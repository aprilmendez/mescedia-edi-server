mescedia :: Open Source EDI [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.1.4-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mescedia/mescedia-edi-server)
============================


### about 

mescedia is an extensible, Java based EDI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange) integration application
for processing most common EDI message formats such as UN/EDIFACT, CSV, XML, Fixed-Length, ... using open standards (XSLT, XQuery, Java, ...). It is build upon existing powerful, production proved Open Source frameworks and libraries such 
as: 

* *Apache-Karaf* :: https://karaf.apache.org 
* *Apache-Camel* :: https://camel.apache.org
* *Smooks*       :: https://www.smooks.org

### prerequisites

1. Make sure that Java is properly installed and working.
2. Download and install the smooks/unedifact project -> https://github.com/smooks/unedifact.

### setup

To build the server run
	
	$ mvn clean install

on macOS run the command with the profile option `-P macOS`

	$ mvn -P macOS clean install

change to karaf-root 	

	$ cd karaf/ 

to start karaf run
  
	$ bin/karaf 	

install mescedia features in apache-karaf
	
	admin@edi-server $ feature:repo-add file:./mescedia-features.xml
	admin@edi-server $ feature:install mescedia  
  
  this might take a while ....  
  you may want to watch the data logs for detailed information during setup 
   
	$ tail -f data/log/karaf.log
	
  copy 'edi-routes.xml' to deploy folder before running the examples below

	$ cp ./edi-routes.xml ./deploy/

### examples

To start the server in background run  

	$ bin/start

##### UN/EDIFACT-TO-XML and vice versa conversions

This setup includes all resources to transform UN/EDIFACT messages to XML and vice versa.  
All message types from EDIFACT version D.93A to D.13A are currently supported. 

Place your messages in the corresponding input folder and see results in your logs and output folders. 
Refer to the camel-routes in $karaf.home/deploy/edi-routes.xml for details.  

 
##### Business Message Exchange Szenarios: XML *[in-out]* UN/EDIFACT *[in-out]* CSV 
 
All data transformation mappings which are used by the example szenarios below are attached to this project.

A retailers ERP imports INVOIC and exports ORDERS messages in CSV format. 
The suppliers ERP on this other hand XML messages. Both retailer and supplier 
exchange UN/EDIFACT (D96A) messages. 

	Supplier (XML) 		UN/EDIFACT			Retailer (CSV)
	-------------------------------------------------------
	ORDERS.xml   < 		ORDERS.edi  <    	ORDERS.csv
	INVOIC.xml   > 		INVOIC.edi  > 		INVOIC.csv

You may refer to the corresponding camel-routes ($karaf.home/deploy/edi-routes.xml) and the contents of the 
$karaf.home/mapping folder in order to understand how the message transformation works. 
		
The testfiles (ORDERS.csv and INVOIC.xml) resist in $karaf.home/testfiles/ folder. 
Copy them to their corresponding inbound destinations (CAMEL_FS/ORDERS_CSV_IN and CAMEL_FS/INVOIC_XML_IN) and watch 
the data logs and output folders for results.
